For instance compare the performance of iterating over an `iterator::iter` versus an [iteror].

```{R}
bench <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  as.list(gen(for (i in iterators::iter(1:1000)) yield(i))),
  as.list(gen(for (i in iteror(1:1000)) yield(i))),
  times=10
)
summary(bench)[, c("expr", "median")]
```

Part of the difference comes from the fact that `gen` must use a `tryCatch` for each time to calls `nextElem` on an `iterator`. Whereas calling `nextOr` on an `iteror` does not involve many calls to `tryCatch`.
