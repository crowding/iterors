For instance compare the performance of iterating over an `iterator::iter` versus an [iteror].

```{R}
bench <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  as.list(gen(for (i in iterators::iter(1:1000)) yield(i))),
  as.list(gen(for (i in iteror(1:1000)) yield(i))),
  times=10
)
summary(bench)[, c("expr", "median")]
```

Part of the difference comes from the fact that `gen` must use a `tryCatch` for each time to calls `nextElem` on an `iterator`. Whereas calling `nextOr` on an `iteror` does not involve many calls to `tryCatch`.

Thanks,

If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
or if those are not available: <https:...>
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for
auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in
quotes: "Title")

Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain
the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the
structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a
function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.
\value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar)
Missing Rd-tags:
#      concat.Rd: \value
#      i_break.Rd: \value
#      i_chunk.Rd: \value
#    i_limit.Rd: \value

get rid of "keywords"

\dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed
(e.g. because of missing additional software, missing API keys, ...) by
the user. That's why wrapping examples in \dontrun{} adds the comment
("# Not run:") as a warning for the user. Does not seem necessary.
Please replace \dontrun with \donttest. -> iRNGStream.Rd

Some code lines in examples are commented out. Please never do that.
Ideally find toy examples that can be regularly executed and checked.
Lengthy examples (> 5 sec), can be wrapped in \donttest{}.
Examples in comments in:
       reduce.Rd

Please do not modifiy the .GlobalEnv. This is not allowed by the CRAN
policies. e.g.: in R/iRNGStream.R; R/rng.R

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Benjamin Altmann
