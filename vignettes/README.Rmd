A fresh take on iterators in R, leading to faster, shorter code.

## Features

 * Main method `nextOr(iter, or)`; allows simpler and faster code.
 * `iteror` objects are cross-compatible with existing code using `iterators` (such as the `foreach` package.)
 * Optimized performance, with often several times less overhead per item.
 * Compatible with Python iterators, via the `reticulate` package.
 * Comes with batteries included: a complete collection of iterator functions, ported, curated and harmonized from packages `iterators`, `itertools`, and `itertools2`,

## How is it different from `iterators`?

`iterors` uses the method `nextOr(it, or)` to retrieve the next element. The trick is that the second argument `or` is lazily evaluated, so it can specify a return value _or_ an action to take at the end of iteration. In particular, `or` can be a control flow operator like `break` or `next` or `return`.

For example, this is how you can compute a sum over an iteror `it`:

```{R eval=FALSE}
total <- 0
repeat total <- total + nextOr(it, break)
```

To contrast with the previous `iterators` package: In that package `nextElem` signals end of iteration by throwing an exception, which means all iterator code had to be written inside a `tryCatch`. Computing a sum over an iterator looked like this:

```{R eval=FALSE}
total <- 0
tryCatch(
  repeat total <- total + nextElem(it),
  error=function(x) {
    if (conditionMessage(x) != "StopIteration") stop(x)
  }
)
```

Besides requiring less boilerplate, iterator code written using `nextOr` also performs faster, particularly when using higher-order iterator functions. This is because `tryCatch` is a relatively expensive operation in R, especially when used once per item. It is also not possible(*) to use `break` or `next` to exit an outer loop from inside a `tryCatch` handler function. while `nextOr` is designed with that use in mind.

The [benchmarking](https://crowding.github.io/iterors/articles/benchmarks.html) vignette illustrates that computations using  `iterors` can execute several times faster than using `iterators`.

The `iterors` package grew out of, and is a complement to, the generators implemented in the [async](https://crowding.github.io/async/) package. [async::gen](https://crowding.github.io/async/reference/gen.html) lets you construct iterators with complex logic, using familiar imperative code with ordinary flow control constructs like `if` `for`, `switch` and so on. Meanwhile, functions in this package `iterors` let you manipulate the output of such a generator in functional style. These two packages form two complementary ways to work with sequential processes.

## Installation

For prerelease, run the following after installing [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools):

```{R, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('crowding/iterors')
```

When the package is released, you will be able to install the stable version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=iterors):

```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('iterors', dependencies=TRUE)
```
