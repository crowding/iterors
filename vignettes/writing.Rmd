```

An _iterator_ is a special type of object that supplies data on
demand, one element [^one] at a time.  This is a nice abstraction
that can help simplify many programs.  Iterators are particularly useful
in parallel computing, since they facilitate splitting a problem into
smaller pieces that can then be executed in parallel.

[^one]: An ``element'' in this case can be basically any object.  I don't mean to suggest that the data is necessarily returned as scalar values, for example.

Iterators can also be used to reduce the total memory that is needed at
any one time.  For example, if you want to process the lines of text in
a file, it is common to write a loop that reads the file one line at a
time, rather than reading the entire file in order to avoid running out
of memory on huge files.  That's the basic idea of iterators.  Iterators
provide a standard method for getting the next element, which allows us
to write functions that take an iterator as an argument to provide a
source of data.  The function doesn't need to know what kind of iterator
it is.  It just needs to know how to get another piece of data.  The
data could be coming from a file, a database, a vector, or it could be
dynamically generated.

There are a number of iterators that come in the `iterors`
package.  The `iteror.array` method allows you to iterate over
arrays, in much the same way as the standard `apply` function.
`apply` has fixed rules on how the results are returned, which
may require you to reshape the results, which can be inefficient, as
well as inconvenient.  But since `i_apply` doesn't process any
data or combine the results, it is more flexible.  You can use
`i_apply` with the `foreach` package to perform a parallel
`apply` operation, and combine the results any way you want via
the `.combine` argument to `foreach`.

Another iterator that comes in the `iterors` package is the
`isplit` function, which works much like the standard
`split` function. `split` returns a list containing all of the data divided into
groups.  `isplit` only generates one group at a time, as they are
needed, which can reduce the amount memory that is needed.

But of course, there will be times when you need an iterator that isn't
provided by the `iterors` package.  That is when you need to
write your own custom iterator.  Fortunately, that is fairly easy to do.

## What methods are needed for an iteror?

Basically, an `iteror` is an S3 object whose base class is
`"iteror"`, which has defined methods called  `nextOr` and `iteror`.

The function `iteror` is a generic method.  The purpose of the
`iteror` method is to construct an iterator for the specified object.
For example, this makes an iteror `it` out of a list:

```{R iterable1}
it <- iteror(list(1:2, 3:4))
```

When `iteror` is called on a list (or any object without a class) it finds the method
`iteror.default`, which constructs an iterator which returns one element
at a time from the given vector.

If `x` is already of class `"iteror"` then `iteror(x)` simply returns `x`, which
seems odd at first.  But the `iteror` method can be defined for
other objects that don't define a `nextOr` method.  We call
those objects _iterables_, meaning that you can iterate over them.
The `iterators` package defines `iteror` methods for
vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames, making those objects
iterables.  By defining an `iteror` method for data types,
you can pass those types directly to any function that expects an iterable.

If you want to create an iterator for some existing class, you can do
that by writing an `iteror` method that constructs an appropriate
iterator. The alternative is to write your own function that takes
arbitrary arguments, and returns an iterator.  You can choose
whichever method is most natural.

The most important method required for iterators is `nextOr(obj, or)`.
Given an iteror `obj`, this simply returns the next value, or forces
and returns its second argument `or.` Returning the value of `or=`
indicates that there are no more values available in the
iterator. There is (by design) no default value for `or`; you need to
specify one.

Above we created an iterator from a list; we can now call `nextOr` on
that iterator to get the values from the list:

```{R iterable2}
nextOr(it, NULL)
nextOr(it, NULL)
nextOr(it, NULL)
```

This shows how `nextOr` behaves at the stop of iteration, returning
whatever value was given to argument `or`. Here we specified NULL, but
we will later see other ways to use the second argument.

## Handling the end of iteration

In many situations, you will be dealing with effectively finite data,
but data for which you don't necessarily know the length. So if you
extract values one at a time from an iterator, you need to handle the
case where there isn't a next value. This is where the `iterors`
package improves on `iterators` by giving you a few options for how to
respond to the end of iteration.

### Breaking out of a loop at end of iteration

If you are consuming an iterator in a loop, the easiest (and often
fastest) way to respond to the end of iteration so to break out of the
loop. You just put a break directly in the second argument of
`nextOr`.

```{R consuming_iter_break}
x <- icount(10)
repeat {
  print(nextOr(x, break))
}
```

Because the `or` argument is lazily evaluated, the
`break` does not execute until `nextOr` evaluates its
second argument. You can put any code into the `or` argument,
which will come in useful below.

### Detecting end of iteration with a signal value

Sometimes a break or return isn't the right action to take.  As we saw
above, `nextOr` will return its second argument (whatever that
is) to signal end of iteration, when the iterator contains no more
data. So you can check whether the returned value is the same as the
one you provided, and interpret that as the end of iteration.

```{R consuming_iter}
x <- icount(10)
while (!is.null(val <- nextOr(x, NULL))) {
  print(val)
}
```

Here, if `nextOr` returns `NULL`, the `while`
loop will exit. A special value used like `NULL` is used above,
is often called a _signal value_.

#### Unsafe signal values

It's popular to use `NULL` as a signal, but it's worth considering what
would happen if there were an iterator that legitimately returns
`NULL` as a value. For instance, this list contains some tricky
values:

```{R bad_iter}
bad_values <- list(
  quote(.StopIteration),
  NA,
  NULL,
  list(),
  simpleError("StopIteration"),
  try(stop("StopIteration", call.=FALSE), silent=TRUE),
  "",
  numeric(0))
```

Suppose you iterate over this list using NULL as your end-of-iteration signal, like this:

```{R enum}
it <- iteror(bad_values)
while (!is.null(val <- nextOr(it, NULL))) {
  print(val)
}
```

The enumeration stops early because it mistakes `NULL`, a legitimate
value in the list that we are iterating over, for `NULL` the signal
value. This is a general problem with the signal value scheme in
dynamically-typed languages; any value you could use to signal a stop,
could also be a legitimate value for an iterator to emit.

#### Safe signal values

A way to escape this problem is to construct a one-shot, _unique_
signal value to use locally, just with this iteror, and then throw
away, not keeping it in your code. One easy way to do this by using
`new.env()`. Consuming an iterator using a local signal value looks
like this:

```{R consuming_signal}
end_signal <- new.env()
it <- iteror(bad_values)
repeat {
  val <- nextOr(it, end_signal)
  if (identical(val, end_signal)) break
  print(val)
}
```

Because environments compare by reference, a newly constructed
environment is guaranteed not to be `identical()` to any other object
in the R session, and the check for identity is very fast (just a
pointer comparison.) By using a locally generated, unique signal value
you avoid mistaking a legitimate value in your data for the end of
iteration.

## A simple iterator

It's time to show the implementation of a very simple iterator.
Although I've made it sound like you have to write your own `nextOr`
methods, you can use a standard one. In fact, that's what all of the
following examples do. The method `iteror.function` takes a function
you specify and wraps it in an object with class `iteror`, which has a
`nextOr` method defined.

Now here's a function that creates a very simple iterator, one that
returns the same value `x` indefinitely.:

```{R iter1}
iforever <- function(x) {
  nextOr_ <- function(or) x
  iteror(nextOr_)
}
```

Note that I called the internal function `nextOr_` with an underscore,
rather than `nextOr`.  I do that by convention to avoid masking the
standard `nextOr` generic function.  That would cause problems when
you want your iterator to call the `nextOr` method of another
iterator, which can be quite useful, as we'll see in a later example.

We create an instance of this iterator by calling the `iforever`
function, and then use it by calling the `nextOr` method on the
resulting object:

```{R runiter1}
it <- iforever(42)
nextOr(it, NULL)
nextOr(it, NULL)
```

You can also get values from an iterator using `as.numeric`.  But
since this is an infinite iterator, you need to also give an argument
`n` argument to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop until you run
out of memory:

```{R runiter1.part2}
as.numeric(it, n=6)
```

Notice that it doesn't make sense to implement this iterator by
defining a new `iteror` method, since there is no natural iterable to
dispatch on; the argument 42 is just a vector of length 1 and
`iterator.default` already handles that case. So instead, we implement
this iterator by defining a normal function that returns the iterator.

This iterator is quite simple to implement, and possibly even
useful. [^3] The iterator returned by `iforever` is actually just the
same function you provided, with the class `iteror` added. This means
you get `nextOr` method already defined, whlch just delegates to your
given function. Additionally since the returned object has class
`iteror`, it inherits an `iteror` method that will return itself.

[^3]: Be careful how you use this iterator!  If you pass it to
    `foreach`, it will result in an infinite loop unless you pair it
    with a non-infinite iterator.  Also, _never_ pass this to the
    `as.list` function without the `n` argument.

Of course, the reason this iterator is so simple is because it doesn't
contain any state.  Most iterators need to contain some state, or it
will be difficult to make it return different values and eventually
stop.  Managing the state is usually the real trick to writing iterators.

## A stateful iterator that stops

Let's modify the previous iterator `iforever` to stop after it
returns a certain number of values.  I'll call the new function
`irep`, and give it another argument called `times`:

```{R iter2}
irep <- function(x, times) {
  nextOr_ <- function(or) {
    if (times > 0) {
      times <<- times - 1
      x
    } else {
      or
    }
  }

  iteror(nextOr_)
}
```

Now let's try it out:

```{R runiter2}
it <- irep(7, 6)
unlist(as.list(it))
```

The differences between `iforever` and `irep` are in the inner
function `nextOr_`. This inner function not only accesses the values
of the variables `x` and `times`, but it also modifies the value of
`times`.  This is accomplished by means of the "`<<-=`"[^1] operator,
and the rules of lexical scoping.

[^1]: It's commonly believed that `<<-` is only used to set
variables in the global environment, but that isn't true.  I think of
it as an _inheriting_ assignment operator.}

After enough calls, the inner function will find `times <= 0`, and
will return `or` argument. As the author of an iterator this is how
you signal end of iteration. When implementing an iterator you never
need to do anything with `or` other than return it when appropriate;
otherwise leave it alone, allowing R to be lazy in treating that
argument.

Technically, this kind of function that refers to enclosing variables
is called a _closure_, and is a fundamental feature of `R`.  The
important thing to remember is that `nextOr_` is able to get the value
of variables that were passed as arguments to `irep`, and it can
modify those values using the `<<-` operator.  These are _not_ global
variables: they are defined in the enclosing environment of the
`nextOr_` function.  You can create as many iterators as you want
using the `irep` function, and they will all work as expected without
conflicts.

Note that this iterator only uses the arguments to `irep` to
store its state.  If any other state variables are needed, they can be
defined anywhere inside the `irep` function.

## Using an iterator inside an iterator

The previous section described a general way of writing custom iterators.
Almost any iterator can be written using those basic techniques.  At times, it
may be simpler to make use of an existing iterator to implement a new iterator.
Let's say that you need an iterator that splits a vector into subvectors.  That
can allow you to process the vector in parallel, but still use vector
operations, which is essential to getting good sequential performance in R.
The following function returns just such an iterator:

```{R iter3}
ivector <- function(x, ...) {
 i <- 1
 it <- idiv(length(x), ...)

 nextOr_ <- function(or) {
   n <- nextOr(it, return(or))
   ix <- seq(i, length=n)
   i <<- i + n
   x[ix]
 }

 iteror(nextOr_)
}
```

`ivector` uses `...` to pass options on to
`idiv`.  `idiv` supports the `chunks` argument
to split its argument into a specified number of pieces, and the
`chunkSize` argument to split it into pieces of a specified
maximum size.

Let's create an `ivector` iterator to split a vector into three
pieces using the `chunks` argument:

```{R runiter3}
it <- ivector(1:25, chunks=3)
as.list(it)
```

Note how our `nextOr_` function handles the end of iteration.  If the
underlying `idiv` iterator reaches the end, it will force its `or`
argument, which we have specified as `return(or)`, Although it is
forced by the underlying iterator, R correctly evaluates a `return`
call in a lazy argument according to the scope that call was written
in. So when `it` of the internal `idiv` reaches the end, and forces
its `or` argument, our `nextOr_` passes that signal along by returning
_its_ `or` argument.

The `nextOr` method uses a lazy evaluated argument expressly for
this purpose, so that you can respond to end of iteration by using a
control flow operator like `return`, `break`, `next` or `stop`.

It should be clear that only minor modification need to be made to this
function to create an iterator over the blocks of rows or columns of a
matrix or data frame.  But I'll leave that as an exercise for the
reader.

## A recycling iterator

You can start to compose simple iterators together to do more complex
things by writing functions that take in one iterator and construct a
new one. In this example, we'll return an iterator that recycles the
values of the wrapped iterator: [^2]

[^2]: Actually, many of the standard `iteror` methods support a
`recycle` argument.  But this is a nice example, and a more general
solution, since it works on any iterator.

```{R recyle}
i_recycle <- function(it) {
  values <- as.list(iteror(it))
  i <- length(values)

  nextOr_ <- function(or) {
    i <<- i + 1
    if (i > length(values)) i <<- 1
    values[[i]]
  }

  iteror(nextOr_)
}
```

This is fairly nice, but note that this is another one of those
infinite iterators that we need to be careful about.  Also, make sure
that you don't pass an infinite iterator to `i_recycle`.  That would
be pointless of course, since there's no reason to recycle an iterator
that never ends.  It would be possible to write this to avoid that
problem by not grabbing all of the values right up front, but you
would still end up saving values that will never be recycled, so I've
opted to keep this simple.

Let's try it out:

```{R recyleexample}
it <- i_recycle(icount(3))
unlist(as.list(it, n=9))
```

## Limiting infinite iterators

I was tempted to add an argument to the `i_recycle` function to
limit the number of values that it returns, because sometimes you want
to recycle for awhile, but not forever.  I didn't do that, because
rather than make `i_recycle` more complicated, I decided to
write another function that takes an iterator and returns a
modified iterator. Functions like this are _composable_; the
limiting function can be applied to any underlying iterator instead of
just `i_recycle`.

```{R i_limit}
i_limit <- function(it, times) {
  it <- iteror(it)

  nextOr_ <- function(or) {
    if (times > 0) {
      times <<- times - 1
      nextOr(it, or)
    } else
      return(or)
  }

  iteror(nextOr_)
}
```

By convention, the `iterors` package uses the prefix `i_` for this
kind of composing iterator function, and a bare `i` for functions that
build an iterator based on basic data.

Note that this looks an awful lot like the `irep` function that
we implemented previously.  In fact, using `i_limit`, we can
implement `irep` using `iforever` much more simply, and
without duplication of code:

```{R irep2}
irep2 <- function(x, times)
  i_limit(iforever(x), times)
```

To demonstrate `irep2`:

```{R testirep2}
it <- irep2('foo', 3)
repeat {
  print(nextOr(it, break))
}
```

Here's one last example.  Let's recycle a vector three times using
`i_limit`, and convert it back into a vector using
`as.numeric`:

```{R testi_recycle}
iterable <- 1:3
n <- 3
it <- i_limit(i_recycle(iterable), n * length(iterable))
as.numeric(it)
```

Sort of a complicated version of:
```{R rep}
rep(iterable, n)
```
Aren't iterators fun?

## Conclusion

Writing your own iterators can be quite simple, and yet is very useful
and powerful.  It provides a very effective way to extend the
capabilities of other packages that use iterators, such as the
`foreach` package.  By writing iterators that wrap other
iterators, it is possible to put together a powerful and flexible set of
tools that work well together, and that can solve many of the complex
problems that come up in parallel computing.
