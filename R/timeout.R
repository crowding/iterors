#' Create a timeout iterator
#'
#' Create an iterator that iterates over another iterator for a specified
#' period of time, and then stops.  This can be useful when you want to search
#' for something, or run a test for awhile, and then stop.
#'
#'
#' @param iterable Iterable to iterate over.
#' @param time The time interval to iterate for, in seconds.
#' @param ... passed along to `iteror(iterable, ...)`
#' @keywords utilities
#' @details Originally from the `itertools` package.
#' @examples
#'
#' # See how high we can count in a tenth of a second
#' length(as.list(i_timeout(icount(), 0.1)))
#'
#' @export i_timeout
i_timeout <- function(iterable, time, ...) {
  force(time)
  it <- iteror(iterable, ...)

  nextOr_ <- function(or) {
    delta <- proc.time()[3] - starttime
    if (delta >= time) return(or)
    it(or = or)
